*Example Rust applications that communicate with Erlang/OTP applications via Erlang Ports*

## Usage

This Rust application is intended to be used as part of the [LFE/OTP Port Examples](https://github.com/lfex/port-examples) project (which includes other language integrations such as Common Lisp and Go).

The parent project should:

* have `cargo` in its `PATH`
* ensure this Rust project gets compiled as a release
* calls the compiled executable to start the Rust server
